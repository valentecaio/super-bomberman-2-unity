# Super Bomberman 2

The current release is available to play here at [valentecaio.ovh/bomberman](https://valentecaio.ovh/bomberman/).

A clone of Super Bomberman 2 (SNES) using Unity.  
Initial version based on [Zigurous class](https://youtu.be/8agb6x5RpOI).  
The only goal of this project is to learn Unity and game development.  
I also try to stay as close as possible to the original game. Same sprites and game dynamics.
