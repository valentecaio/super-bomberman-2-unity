# Super Bomberman 2
A clone of Super Bomberman 2 (SNES) using Unity.  
Initial version based on [Zigurous class](https://youtu.be/8agb6x5RpOI).  
The only goal of this project is to teach myself Unity and game dev.  
I also try to stay as close as possible to the original game. Same sprites and game dynamics.
